This a story about failure. It's not a new story. It's not a particularly unique story. But it's my story, and I'm telling it because I know that there are other people out there who feel like I have felt for so many years. Have you experienced disappointment in your life? Do you feel trapped in a job you hate? Have you believed that you found your calling only to find that it wasn't at all? Do you want to change your life and your career? Does it seem impossible? Do you wonder how you can make it happen? Are you afraid? You are not alone. I have felt this way and more, but I was able to change everything. I'm not going to tell you how to do it, because everyone's circumstances are unique to them, but I'll tell you my story in hopes that you will find that you can do it too.
