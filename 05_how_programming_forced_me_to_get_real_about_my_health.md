I really wanted to write a more technical post this week, but something happened last Saturday that made me feel like this was more important. So here's the story. I took my kids to play at a children's museum we have here in Portland. It was great, nothing out of the ordinary, until we sat down for a snack. I went to use the restroom before setting them loose to play some more, and that's when I saw it for the first time. My gut had swollen. A lot.

I didn't really think too much about it, until a couple days later when I was standing shirtless in the kitchen having coffee with my wife. I looked down and there it was again. "Have I gained weight?" I asked her. Straight to the point as always, she replied, "Yeah, you really have."

So I stepped on the scale and, sure enough, since leaving my job to study web development full-time, I had gained twenty pounds.

To me, this was startling. You have to understand, I've worked physically demanding jobs since I was in high school. The least physical job I have ever had still required me to take over 13,000 steps a day. I never really felt like I needed to focus on my health because I always felt fine. Fast forward to today, where I spend hours in front of a computer every day, pound Red Bulls and coffee, and my average step count has dropped somewhere between 1,500 and 2,500. I have to admit to myself that I don't really feel fine anymore.

It only took a Google search to convince me that I'm not the only one who had experienced this.
